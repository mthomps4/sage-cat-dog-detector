# AWS Batch vs SageMaker: A Deep Dive Comparison for ML Training

## Introduction

When it comes to training machine learning models on AWS, two services often come up in discussion: AWS Batch and Amazon SageMaker. While both can handle ML workloads, they serve different needs and use cases. This comprehensive guide will help you choose the right service for your ML training needs.

### What is AWS Batch?
AWS Batch is a managed compute service that enables running batch computing workloads on AWS. It's not ML-specific but excels at:
- Running containerized workloads
- Managing compute resources
- Handling job dependencies and queuing
- Supporting both CPU and GPU workloads

### What is SageMaker?
Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed ML service that covers the entire ML workflow:
- Data labeling and preparation
- Model training and tuning
- Deployment and monitoring
- Built-in ML algorithms and frameworks
