# Cat vs Dog Image Classifier

This project demonstrates a simple image classification model that distinguishes between cats and dogs. It's built as a learning exercise, starting with local development and eventually moving to AWS SageMaker deployment.

```

## Local Development

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd cat_dog_classifier
```

2. Run the setup script:

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

### Training

1. Ensure you have images in the data directory:
   - Place cat images in `data/cats/`
   - Place dog images in `data/dogs/`

2. Run the training script:

```bash
# Activate your virtual environment if not already activated
source venv/bin/activate

# Train the model
python src/train.py
```

3. The trained model will be saved as `cat_dog_model.pth`

### Inference

Use the trained model to classify new images:

```bash
chmod +x predict.sh

# Basic usage
./predict.sh path/to/image.jpg

# Specify a different model
./predict.py path/to/image.jpg path/to/other/model.pth
```

## AWS SageMaker Setup

### 1. Create SageMaker Domain

1. Navigate to Amazon SageMaker in AWS Console
2. Click "Create a Unified Studio domain"
3. Domain setup:
   - Name: "Cat Dog Image Predictor"
   - Description: "Testing Sage with simple Cat Dog image recognition model"
   - Authentication: Default (AWS IAM)
   - Network and Storage: Default VPC settings
   - Permissions: Use default execution role

### 2. Configure Project Profile

1. After domain creation, locate "Next steps for your domain"
2. Under "Create a project profile", click "Configure" next to "Data analytics and AI/ML model development"
   - This profile provides tools for:
     - Building ML models
     - Training and deployment
     - Integration with SageMaker capabilities
   - Skip other profiles (Generative AI, SQL analytics) as they're not needed for our use case

### 3. Studio Environment Setup

1. Open SageMaker Studio
2. Click "Create project" (green button in top right)
3. Project setup:
   - Choose a template (we'll use "ML Ops template")
   - Name: "cat-dog-classifier"
   - Description: Optional description of your project
   - Force push code the new project repo
   - This creates a managed workspace for our:
     - Code
     - Notebooks
     - Model artifacts
     - Deployment configurations

### 4. Create Notebook (Next Step)

After project creation:

1. Navigate to "ML and generative AI model development"
2. Create notebook within our project
3. Set up training configuration

### Current Project Status

- âœ… Domain Created
- âœ… S3 Bucket Setup with Training Data
- âœ… Local Model Working
- âœ… Project Profile Configured
- âœ… Studio Access
- ðŸ”„ Creating Project
- â¬œ Creating Training Notebook

- â¬œ Model Deployment

### Project Resources

- Domain URL: https://[your-domain].sagemaker.us-east-1.on.aws/
- S3 Training Data: s3://[your-bucket]/training_data/

## Model Architecture

The current model is a simple CNN with:

- 2 convolutional layers
- Max pooling
- ReLU activation
- Final fully connected layer

## Dataset

- Input: RGB images (resized to 224x224)
- Classes: Cat, Dog
- Split: 80% training, 20% testing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- If you get an error about missing modules, make sure your virtual environment is activated:

  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate  # On Mac/Linux
  venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
  ```

- If you have issues with image loading, check that your images are valid JPEG/PNG files and are in the correct directories.

- If the model file isn't found during prediction, make sure you're running the script from the project root directory or specify the full path to the model.
